      <p>
        I am an undergraduate student at Portland State University studying
        computer science and physics. This is where I'll share all the cool
        projects that I make

        <h3>recipeBox</h3>
        <p>
          A fullstack web application for restaurants to store their recipes. I
          made this when I was working as a cook at a restaurant and all our
          recipes were stored on one big google doc. It was a nightmare to deal
          with so I made this so that everyone could easily
          create/read/update/delete recipes.

        <h3>Plant Disease Classifier</h3>
        <p>
          A trained resnet model that identifies diseases in plants. I wanted to
          teach myself machine learning and I was particulary interested in
          computer vision. I followed Jeremy Howards fastai course and this is
          what I came up with. I think it's super cool!
